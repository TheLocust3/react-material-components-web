# Material Components Web for React
Simple React wrappers for MCW components.

### To-do
- More component wrappers
  - Indeterminate checkbox
- Support dark theme components
- Support custom classes on components
- Generate unique id
- Tests
- Publish to NPM
- Material Component adapters instead of just wrapping
- Make sure user doesn't have to import stylesheets

### Issues
- Checkbox labels aren't vertically centered
  - Checkbox doesn't show grey circle on hover

### Skipped Components
I'm skipping a few components that I don't think are widely used for now. I'll go back through and add them later
Currently skipped:
- Text Field Boxes
- Forms
