# Material Components Web for React
Simple React wrappers for MCW components.

To use you must currently include:  
`<link rel="stylesheet" href="/material-components-web.css">`  
`<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">`  

### To-do
- More component wrappers
  - Indeterminate checkbox
  - Dialog and snackbar open animation
  - Properly handle multi-select on change
  - Slider default value
  - Drawer
  - Layout grid
  - List
  - Menu
  - Tabs
  - Toolbar
  - Typography
- Support dark theme components
- Support custom classes on components
- Generate unique id
- Tests
- Publish to NPM
- Material Component adapters instead of just wrapping
- Make sure user doesn't have to import stylesheets
- Make sure there are no missing options for an components

### Issues
- Checkbox labels aren't vertically centered
  - Checkbox doesn't show grey circle on hover

### Skipped Components
I'm skipping a few components that I don't think are widely used for now. I'll go back through and add them later
Currently skipped:
- Text Field Boxes
- Forms
